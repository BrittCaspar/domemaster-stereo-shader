Mac OS X Installation Notes
--------------------------------

If you are running Mac OS X 10.8, 10.9, or 10.10 you need to open your System Preferences and adjust the Security & Privacy settings to allow apps downloaded from "Anywhere" to run.

This will allow the unsigned Domemaster3D installer to create the /Applications/Domemaster3D resource folder.


Mac Notes
----------
The minimum Mac OS X version required to run the compiled versions of the Domemaster3D mental ray shaders is now Mac OS X 10.8 due to the version of Xcode used to compile the current .dylib library files. 

If you need support for older versions of Mac OS X, you can compile the shaders locally on a legacy Mac OS X system using the included Makefiles and the shaders will run on systems as old as Mac OS X 10.6:
