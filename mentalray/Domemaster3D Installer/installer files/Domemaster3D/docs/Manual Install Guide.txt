# Domemaster3D Manual Install Guide for Maya, Max, and Mental Ray Standalone #
Version 1.9.2 - January 11, 2016

## Render Farm Note ##

If you are running a commercial render farm service that offers Domemaster3D rendering for Maya, 3DS Max, or XSI, contact Andrew Hazelden ( andrew@andrewhazelden.com) and he will include you on the public list of Domemaster3D enabled render farms.

## Install Guide for Maya 2010 to 2016 on Linux ##

Step 1. Extract the ZIP file and copy the included "Domemaster3D" folder to:
/opt/Domemaster3D/

Step 2. You can choose to use the classical Maya.env file or the new Maya Module approach to load the Domemaster3D shader in Maya.

Maya Module Approach
If you are using Maya 2013-2016 you have the option of using the Domemaster3D.mod Maya module file for setting up the Domemaster3D shader in Maya. This approach works well in multi-user environments like media labs.

Copy the Domemaster3D.mod Maya module file from /opt/Domemaster3D/maya/modules/Domemaster3D.mod to your user account's Maya modules folder:
$HOME/maya/<Maya Version Number>/modules/

Note: If the modules folder doesn't exist yet, you should create it.

Maya ENV Approach
Copy the Maya.env file to the user's maya version specific settings folder. A Maya.env file is used to specify the custom shader path for the Domemaster3D mental ray shaders, the location of the Maya shelf, the scripts folder, the attrPresets folder, and the icons folders.

The Domemaster3D shader's Maya.env files are located in:
/opt/Domemaster3D/maya/<Maya Version Number>/

The Maya.env files for each specific Maya version are named:
Maya.env.linux
Maya.env.osx
Maya.env.win

To use the appropriate Maya.env file you need to select the right one
for your platform, rename it to "Maya.env", and copy it to your user
account's "Maya version-x64" folder:
$HOME/maya/<Maya Version Number>/

Step 3. Make sure you have ImageMagick Installed. The Domemaster3D shader uses ImageMagick to power the DomeText and Dome Histogram tools in Maya.

If you don't have ImageMagick, you can install it on Redhat / CentOS / Fedora Linux using the following terminal commands:
sudo yum update 
sudo yum install ImageMagick

If you are running Ubuntu / Debian Linux you can install ImageMagick using the following terminal commands:
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install imagemagick

## Notes ##
The Domemaster3D shader v1.9 was compiled using CentOS Linux 6.4. 

If there are any issues with running the shader, the developer can be reached at:

## Install Guide for Maya 2010 to 2016 x64 on Windows ##

Step 1. Extract the ZIP file and copy the included "Domemaster3D" folder to:
C:\Program Files\Domemaster3D\


Step 2. You can choose to use the classical Maya.env file or the new Maya Module approach to load the Domemaster3D shader in Maya.

Maya Module Approach
If you are using Maya 2013-2016 you have the option of using the Domemaster3D.mod Maya module file for setting up the Domemaster3D shader in Maya. This approach works well in multi-user environments like media labs.

Copy the Domemaster3D.mod Maya module file from C:\Program Files\Domemaster3D\maya\modules\Domemaster3D.mod to your user account's Maya modules folder:
C:\Users\<Your User Account>\Documents\Maya\<Maya Version Number>\modules\

Note: If the modules folder doesn't exist yet, you should create it.

Maya ENV Approach
Copy the Maya.env file to the user's maya version specific settings folder. A Maya.env file is used to specify the custom shader path for the Domemaster3D mental ray shaders, the location of the Maya shelf, the scripts folder, the attrPresets folder, and the icons folders.

The Domemaster3D shader's Maya.env files are located in:
C:\Program Files\Domemaster3D\maya\<Maya Version Number>\

The Maya.env files for each specific Maya version are named:
Maya.env.linux
Maya.env.osx
Maya.env.win

To use the appropriate Maya.env file you need to select the right one
for your platform, rename it to "Maya.env", and copy it to your user
account's "Maya version-x64" folder:
C:\Users\<Your User Account>\Documents\Maya\<Maya Version Number>\


Step 3. Add the Domemaster3D "bin" folder to your Windows System path:
C:\Program Files\Domemaster3D\bin

This is done by opening the System Control panel, and selecting Advanced
System Properties > Environment Variables and then editing the current
"Path" system variable.

Step 4. The Domemaster3D v1.9 release for Windows has been compiled with Visual Studio 2012. If your system doesn't have the Visual Studio 2012 (VC++ 11.0) x64 Redistributable Package installed you can download it here:

## Install Guide for Maya 2011 to 2016 x64 on Mac OS X ##

Step 1. Extract the ZIP file and copy the included "Domemaster3D" folder to:
/Applications/Domemaster3D/

Step 2. You can choose to use the classical Maya.env file or the new Maya Module approach to load the Domemaster3D shader in Maya.

Maya Module Approach
If you are using Maya 2013-2016 you have the option of using the Domemaster3D.mod Maya module file for setting up the Domemaster3D shader in Maya. This approach works well in multi-user environments like media labs.

Copy the Domemaster3D.mod Maya module file from /Applications/Domemaster3D/maya/modules/Domemaster3D.mod to your user account's Maya modules folder:
/Applications/Domemaster3D/<Maya Version Number>/modules/

Note: If the modules folder doesn't exist yet, you should create it.

Maya ENV Approach
Copy the Maya.env file to the user's  maya version specific settings folder. A Maya.env file is used to specify the custom shader path for the Domemaster3D mental ray shaders, the location of the Maya shelf, the scripts folder, the attrPresets folder, and the icons folders.

The Domemaster3D shader's Maya.env files are located in:
/Applications/Domemaster3D/<Maya Version Number>/

The Maya.env files for each specific Maya version are named:
Maya.env.linux
Maya.env.osx
Maya.env.win

To use the appropriate Maya.env file you need to select the right one
for your platform, rename it to "Maya.env", and copy it to your user
account's "Maya version-x64" folder:
~/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/<Maya Version Number>/Maya.env


Step 3. If you are running Mac OS X 10.9, 10.10, or 10.11 you need to open your System Preferences and adjust the Security & Privacy settings to allow apps downloaded from "Anywhere" to run. This will allow Maya to run the unsigned Domemaster3D shader.

Step 4. (Optional) If you are interested in using the DomeText tool or the Dome Histogram tool on Mac OS X, the ImageMagick library has to be installed separately. This only has to be done on the artist's workstation system and is not required on render farm systems.

For the technically inclined Mac user you can install ImageMagick using Xcode and the Mac Ports tool ( https://www.macports.org/ ) with the terminal command: 
sudo ports install ImageMagick

## Domemaster3D & LatLong Stereo Maya RenderFarm Notes ##

The Domemaster3D shader typically uses a Pre-render and Post-render MEL scripts to control the stereoscopic settings on the domeAFL_FOV_Stereo fulldome camera rig at render time.

If the Domemaster3D shader is installed on a render farm that does not allow jobs to be submitted with Pre-render and Post-render MEL scripts in the Render Settings window, render farm customers should remove any Pre-render or Post-render MEL script commands in their Maya render settings.

If the render farm customer is rendering a 2D fulldome Maya scene everything is ready.

If the render farm customer is rendering a 3D fulldome or LatlongStereo scene have them run the following MEL command on their personal workstation before sending you the maya scene file: 
source "domeRender.mel"; domemaster3DPreRenderMEL();

This can also be acheived using the Domemaster3D "REM" shelf icon to remove the pre-render/post-render Mel scripts, or by running the Domemaster3D menu command "Remove Pre/Post Render Mel".

This will make sure the camera's field of view is correct and the stereo rig is ready to render.

If there are lens shader artifacts that show up in Domemaster3D or LatLongStereo renderings, you can advise your customers to eliminate them by using the Domemaster3D shelf's native mental ray texturing tools when applying surface materials to objects in the scene. Also the applying Maya native camera shape FOV overrides (that are discussed on the Maya Domemaster3D Wiki's Tip's and Tricks page) can be used as another tool to help reduce/eliminate the lens shading artifacts.
