Step 1. Use Cygwin/Terminal to remove any of the Mac OS style ".ds-store" files:

cd /cygdrive/c/Users/Administrator/Documents/GitHub/domemaster-stereo-shader
find . -name '*.DS_Store' -type f -delete


Step 2. Build the Bitrock Install Builder based installers for Mac & Windows using the file:

~\GitHub\domemaster-stereo-shader\mentalray\Domemaster3D Installer\Domemaster3D.xml


Step 3. Create the following ZIP archives:

Domemaster3D-X.X-Linux-Mac-Windows-Manual-Install.zip

        Domemaster3D Readme-Short.txt
        Mac OS X Installation Notes.txt
        Manual Install Guide.txt
        
Domemaster3D-X.X-osx-installer.zip
    Domemaster3D-X.X-osx-installer.app

    Mac OS X Installation Notes.txt

Domemaster3D-X.X-windows-installer.zip
