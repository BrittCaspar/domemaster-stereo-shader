The Domemaster Stereo Shader is a set of fulldome stereo and latlong stereo production lens shaders for 3DS Max, Maya, Softimage, Houdini, Maxwell Studio, Mental Ray Standalone, Vray Standalone, and Arnold Standalone. The lens shaders are available for Mental Ray, Vray, and Arnold, and comes integrated in Maxwell Render version 3.1+.

This guide covers the Vray for Softimage version of the Domemaster3D Shaders.

## <a name="known-issues"></a>Known Issues ##

The current version of the Vray Domemaster3D shaders (as of 2015-05-23 ) is a development build.

- A basic set of Vray for Sofimage SPDL and DSPreset files have been created for the DomemasterStereo and LatLongStereo lens shaders. 

- The lens shader GUIs show up in Softimage but I haven't figured out the Softimage to Vray translator features yet which are required to export the lens shader data to a .vrscene file or activate the shader in the Vray Frame Buffer window.
