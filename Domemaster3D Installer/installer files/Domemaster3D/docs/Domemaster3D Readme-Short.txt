Domemaster3D Stereo Lens Shader for Maya x64 and 3DS Max x64
Version 2.2.1 - December 27, 2016

About This Shader
---------------------
The Domemaster Stereo lens shader is a custom mental ray shader that creates a stereoscopic 3D fisheye image. The lens shader provides advanced controls to optimize the viewing experience for stereoscopic dome renderings. 

The shader collection also supports fulldome 2D rendering using either the DomeAFL_FOV shader, the DomeAFL_WxH shader, or the "Center" camera option in the DomeAFL_FOV_Stereo shader. 

Latitude Longitude rendering (also known as spherical or equirectangular output) is supported with the help of the latlong_lens shader, and the stereoscopic LatLong_Stereo shader.

Note: The previous Domemaster3D Shader v1.5 has updated the Maya Binary (.mb) Node ID codes used for the domeAFL and latlong_lens shaders. If you open a .mb file created in a previous Domemaster3D release, you should use the "upgrade" tool in the Domemaster3D shelf to modify the Node ID codes. Lens shader nodes that need to be updated will have their icons replaced in the Hypershade with the red text that reads "NodeID Upgrade Required."

macOS Notes
----------
The minimum macOS version required to run the compiled versions of the Domemaster3D mental ray shaders is now macOS 10.9 due to the version of Xcode used to compile the current .dylib library files. 

If you need support for older versions of macOS, you can compile the shaders locally on a legacy macOS system using the included Makefiles and the shaders will run on systems as old as macOS 10.6.

  New Domemaster3D installer packaged.

Version 2.1.3
-------------
2016-10-04

Maya
	Recompiled the mental ray 3.14 for macOS versions of the lens shaders that are capable of working with Maya 2016/2016.5/2017. The newly compiled mental ray 3.14 lens shaders work with macOS 10.9+ Mavericks.
	
Version 2.1.2
-------------
2016-09-17

Arnold
  Updated the Maya based "Arnold Domemaster3D" menu and shelf to add 2D rendering style entries for creating Domemaster FOV 2D and LatLong 2D renderings using the center camera view in the existing stereo lens shaders.

  Added the DomeGrid function createDomeGrid() to create a spherical yellow reference grid in Maya.
  
  Edited the Dome Grid creation script so the catch command is used to handle the event that mental ray might not be installed and a doPaintEffectsToPoly function based Maya code dependency is going to try and change the .miFinalGatherCast attribute. Adjusted the line thickness, default light brightness setting, and the shadow settings on the Dome Grid.

  Updated the Arnold Domemaster3D menu items and created an "Open Directories" section to better categorize the entries.

Vray
  Added the DomeGrid function createDomeGrid() to create a spherical yellow reference grid in Maya.

  Updated the Vray Automagic tool's Autosetup() function to add the DomeGrid and test shapes.

  Edited the Dome Grid creation script so the catch command is used to handle the event that mental ray might not be installed and a doPaintEffectsToPoly function based Maya code dependency is going to try and change the .miFinalGatherCast attribute. Adjusted the line thickness on the Dome Grid.

  Updated the Vray Domemaster3D menu items and created an "Open Directories" section to better categorize the entries.

Maya
  Updated Domemaster3D menu for compatibility with Maya 2017 + mental ray 3.14 beta 9
  
  Added an Automagic LatLong 3D Scene shelf button to the mental ray Domemaster3D shelf that creates a LatLong_Stereo based test scene
  
  Updated mental ray shader source code + makefiles for mental ray 3.14 ray differential texture sampling
  
  Improved the domeRadius.mel, domeCamera.py, domeMaterial.py, AEdomeAFL_FOV_StereoTemplate.mel, AEdomeAFL_FOVTemplate.mel, and domeHistogram.mel script's Maya 2017 compatibility by fixing the MEL "Redeclaration of variable" warnings
  
  The domeMenu.mel script has been unified so Maya 2010-2017 all use the same MEL script file that is now stored in the Domemaster3D/maya/common/scripts folder
  
  Edited the Dome Grid creation script so the catch command is used to handle the event that mental ray might not be installed and a doPaintEffectsToPoly function based Maya code dependency is going to try and change the .miFinalGatherCast attribute. Adjusted the line thickness on the Dome Grid.
  
  Renamed the Domemaster3D shelf open project icon label text from "PRO" to "PROJ"
  
  Updated the Domemaster3D menu items and created an "Open Directories" section to better categorize the entries.
  
  Added new MEL functions to the domeRender.mel script to enable the mental ray 3.14 ray differential based elliptical filtering mode on Maya file node based texture maps:
  
  // List all of the Maya file nodes and examine the new mental ray elliptical filtering modes:

  // List the selected file nodes
  source "domeRender.mel";
  domeListMayaFileNodes(1);

  // List all file nodes in the scene
  source "domeRender.mel";
  domeListMayaFileNodes(0);

  // Update all of the Maya file nodes to use the new mental ray elliptical filtering modes:
  
  // Update the selected file nodes
  source "domeRender.mel";
  domeUpdateMayaFileNodes(1);
  
  // Update all file nodes in the scene
  source "domeRender.mel";
  domeUpdateMayaFileNodes(0);
  
Version 2.1.1
-------------
2016-09-11

Arnold
  Updated the LatLong Stereo shader defaults for the camera orientation and enabled the Zenith Mode checkbox

Version 2.1
-------------
2016-09-06

Maya
  Added initial Maya 2017 Support

  Added a mental ray native texture based Maya example project file named "Domemaster3D_transparent_materials_project.zip" that shows how to map a color material with a separate alpha channel to an mia_material. It is stored in the folder:
  
    C:\Program Files\Domemaster3D\docs\Maya_Examples\
    /Applications/Domemaster3D/docs/Maya_Examples/
    /opt/Domemaster3D/docs/Maya_Examples/
  
  Updated the Dome Diagnostics script to use Maya workspace based file paths. Added a "domeOpenVrayRenderLogFile();" function for opening the Vray for Maya render log file.
  
  Started improving the Domemaster3D/Vray for Maya integration. Added a new "VrayDomemaster3D.mod" Maya module file, updated the shelf tool items, and added new "VRay Domemaster3D" menu in the Maya Rendering menu set. 
  
  Started improving the Domemaster3D/Arnold for Maya integration. Updated the "ArnoldDomemaster3D.mod" Maya module file, updated the shelf tool items, and added a new "Arnold Domemaster3D" menu in the Maya rendering menu set.
  
  Added support in Maya 2016/2017 for creating Maya file node based screen space texture maps in the LatLong_Stereo and domeAFL_FOV_Stereo shaders, and in the screen space texture map shelf tool with the help of a mib_texture_vector node and a place2Dtexture node. This replaces the previous mentalrayTexture node based approach that has been depreciated in the Maya 2017/mental ray 3.14 beta releases.
  
  Updated the mental ray shader source code to create a new mental ray 3.14 version of the code that will support the new ray differential texture sampling mode. This new rendering mode will hopefully eliminate the "blurry streak" lens shader artifact seen on Maya file node based textures in panoramic scenes and remove the need to use mental ray native textures as a work around. This ray differential based lens shader feature can't be enabled until the beta 9 release of mental ray for Maya 2017 is released.
    
  Added a new Open Maya Project Folder "PRO" shelf button and Domemaster3D menu item. This button makes it easy to open the current Maya project folder in a new Finder/Explorer/Nautilus file browser window.
