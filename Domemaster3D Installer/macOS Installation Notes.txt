macOS Installation Notes
--------------------------------

The minimum macOS version required to run the compiled versions of the Domemaster3D mental ray shaders is macOS 10.9 due to the version of Xcode used to compile the current .dylib library files. 

If you need support for older versions of macOS, you can compile the shaders locally on a legacy macOS system using the included Makefiles and the shaders will run on systems as old as macOS 10.6:
